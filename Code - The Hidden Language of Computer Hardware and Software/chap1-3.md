### Chapter 1: Best Friends
> The key word here is two. Two types of blinks, two vowel sounds, two different anything, really, can with suitable combinations convey all types of information.

### Chapter 2: Codes and COmbinations
> Combinations of binary objects (such as coins) and binary codes (such as Morse code) are always described by powers of two. Two is a very important number in this book.

### Chapter 3: Braille and Binary Codes
- Braille used a binary system which multipurposed the letters 'a' through 'j' to prevent adding more than 6 dots/cells, which i found very similar to language, as many things are repurposed in different situations to prevent redundancy in a sense.

Thoughts: The key here for the first three chapters were obviously emphasising the importance of binary code, which will later likely relate to the binary system used in computer architecture of gates and such, which i am looking forward to.
